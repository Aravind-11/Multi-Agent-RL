## Two Player Soccer

Welcome to Two Player Soccer, a zero-sum game where two agents compete against each other to score the most goals in a soccer setting.

### Game Rules

* At the start of the game, one of the agents is randomly given the ball.
* The goal of the agent with the ball is to move it to the opposing team's goal post and score a point.
* If the agent with the ball comes in contact with the other agent, the ball is transferred to the other agent. The agent that loses the ball receives a penalty.
